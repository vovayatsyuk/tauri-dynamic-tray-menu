# Tauri + Vanilla

https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri/issues/7957

This repo is a small reproduction of the dynamic tray menu. Each second we
replace the menu with a new one. You can check this by opening the menu multiple
times. However, when the menu is opened you will not see any updates until you
reopen the menu.

## Running

```
npm run tauri dev
```
